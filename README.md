Menu dropdown with the FutureLearn pattern library
==================================================

#### The result of my attempt at this task is published here: [https://lucymac.github.io/menu-dropdown/](https://lucymac.github.io/menu-dropdown/)

*Click on the pink avatar to see the menu!*


The exercise was limited to 2 hours.

I did not have the time to:

* Test it and fix for all browsers
* Add the drop shadow on the white arrow (I left a grey arrow instead)
* Perfect the padding for all menu items 
* Properly centre the initials inside the avatar

Note I also used a Google font which I thought looked similar to Europa.


### About the exercise

The task was to reproduce an avatar and menu dropdown as per this visual: [`visual-user-options-menu.png`](visuals/visual-user-options-menu.png)

The user story for this exercise was: *"As a Learner, I'd like to view user menu options available to me, accessible from my avatar, So that I can navigate around the site."*
